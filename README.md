Project Title: Farmer’s Market Locator app
Project Description: 
A simple user interface that grabs data about farmers markets and their location.  This search can be narrowed or broadened by city, state, or even distance within a search radius.  Upon retrieving location results user is presented with search data and given the option to navigate to the market. 

User Story: 
	As a human who enjoys fresh and local foods
	I want to locate local farmer’s markets
	So that I can shop local and support the community.

APIs to be used:

https://developers.google.com/maps/
Possibly more (weather, ratings via Yelp)

Rough breakdown of tasks: 
Link the app homepage to the USDA Local food directory platform so that we can complete fetch requests
Link the fetch request data to google maps so enable directions based on user location.
A UI that is intuitive and polished
Store search data on user side server
